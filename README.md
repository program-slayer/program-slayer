## Peace be upon the People

## Learning for life, finding morality in AI, and documenting the rest.

This repository (and my GitHub in general) is a living document — a place where learning is continuous, ethics are questioned seriously, and whatever remains is documented honestly.

Below is a simple guide to understand, **who I am, what I work on, the tools I use, and how to reach me**.

---

### Who am I?

I’m a lifelong learner, curious across disciplines rather than confined to one. My interests sit at the intersection of **humanities, science/computer science, and economics**.


---

### What am I currently working on?

* Exploring **AI through a moral and human lens** — questioning not just *what* we can build, but *what we should*.
* Personal experiments, notes, and small projects that help me understand systems, behavior, and intelligence.

Expect unfinished ideas, evolving thoughts, and repositories that grow slowly but deliberately.

---

### What tools do I use?

My tools change as my questions change, but commonly include:

* Programming languages like python and frameworks relevant to AI, automation, and web systems 
* Design tools like figma for visual thinking and clarity
* Writing and documentation as first‑class tools
* Open‑source platforms to learn in public and build with accountability
